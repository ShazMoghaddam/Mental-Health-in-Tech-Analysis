🧠 Mental Health in the Tech Workplace

End-to-End Data Science Project

📌 Project Overview

Mental health is a critical but often under-discussed issue in the technology sector.
This project analyses survey data collected from professionals working in tech to understand factors influencing mental health treatment, workplace support, and employee well-being.

The project demonstrates a complete data science workflow, from raw CSV data to insights and machine learning, and is designed as a portfolio project to showcase practical skills in Python, data analysis, visualisation, and modelling.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess a real-world dataset

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualise trends and relationships using multiple techniques

Build a machine learning model to predict treatment-seeking behaviour

Extract meaningful insights and communicate findings clearly

🗂️ Dataset

Source: Kaggle

Dataset Name: Mental Health in Tech Survey

Format: CSV

Description:
A survey dataset capturing demographic information, workplace environment, family history, and mental health treatment among tech professionals.

📎 Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas, numpy (data manipulation)

matplotlib, seaborn (data visualisation)

scikit-learn (machine learning)

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Loading & Inspection

Imported CSV data

Examined structure, data types, and missing values

2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values

Removed unrealistic age outliers

Standardised inconsistent categorical values (e.g. gender)

Selected relevant features for analysis and modelling

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analysed relationships between mental health treatment and:

Gender

Family history

Work interference

Used multiple visualisation approaches:

Count plots

Bar charts

Crosstab-based visualisations

4️⃣ Feature Engineering

Encoded categorical variables

Prepared data for machine learning models

5️⃣ Machine Learning

Built a Logistic Regression model

Predicted likelihood of seeking mental health treatment

Evaluated performance using:

Classification report

Confusion matrix

📊 Key Findings & Insights

Employees with a family history of mental illness are significantly more likely to seek treatment

Workplace interference strongly correlates with treatment-seeking behaviour

Gender-based differences exist in reported treatment rates

Psychosocial factors are more influential than age alone

🚀 Future Improvements

Implement advanced models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

Perform text analysis on free-text survey responses

Explore company-size or region-based trends

Deploy findings in an interactive dashboard
